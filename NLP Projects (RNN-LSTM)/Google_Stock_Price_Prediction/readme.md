# GOOGLE STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
This project is based on stock price prediction for sequential data 
### Methods used are
* LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory
* GRU - Gated Recurrent Unit

GRU is another type of recurrent neural network (RNN) cell that is computationally less expensive than LSTM while providing similar performance in many cases.

For our case the comparision graphs between LSTM and GRU are :- 

1. LSTM

2. GRU
